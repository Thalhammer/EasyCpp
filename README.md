# Warning
I consider this library deprecated.
It has a lot of bugs and misconceptions.
Most of the included features will get included into [ttl](https://github.com/Thalhammer/ttl).
If you like it consider contributing the part you like to ttl instead.
The web part is superseeded by [mod_grpcbackend](https://github.com/Thalhammer/mod_grpcbackend) and [grpcbacked_cpp](https://github.com/Thalhammer/grpcbackend_cpp).

# EasyCpp
A library to make creating projects in C++ a lot easier.
